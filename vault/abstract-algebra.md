# 1. Motivation

As per my understanding, abstract algebra's goal is to represent systems as abstractly (mathematically) as possible.
I think this is essential for reuse (especially of software or understanding - e.g. springs in mechanics and capacitors in electrostatics).

I wish to reuse all my understanding of various things. I wish to learn abstract algebra in order to express concepts in an asbtract way, so I can check and reuse them whenever possible.
Another powerful thing about abstract algebra is that once systems are represented abstractly, various unobserved facets can be discovered easily. Also, biases emanating from domain knowledge/experience can be overcome if the system is represented abstractly.
